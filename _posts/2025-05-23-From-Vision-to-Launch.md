# Turning a Vision of Inclusion into a Tech-Driven Reality

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share something I‚Äôve been working on and is truly a dream 7 years in the making. I‚Äôm so excited to launch my independent Salesforce Consulting Company Love unITed Solutions, this is such an exciting journey for me to take on and I‚Äôm beyond excited to share this journey with you all!

Starting Love unITed Solutions wasn‚Äôt just a career move ‚Äî it was a leap of purpose.

After years of working in the Salesforce ecosystem, I saw firsthand how powerful the platform can be when aligned with strategy, clarity, and people. But I also saw how often teams struggled with confusing systems, low adoption, and disconnected processes.

I knew I wanted to change that ‚Äî so I launched Love unITed Solutions: a Salesforce consultancy that helps organizations build smarter, cleaner, more human solutions. Solutions that don‚Äôt just work ‚Äî they work for you.

## Why "Love unITed Solutions"?

The name comes directly from my first ever developer org that I created in Trailhead just over 7 years ago (I still have the email to this day) and it to me really reflects everything we stand for. 

**Love:** One of the greatest strengths I‚Äôve consistently been recognized for is my ability to build meaningful connections. This strength is rooted in a core belief that every individual deserves to be treated with fairness, equity, and respect. These values are more than just principles‚Äîthey‚Äôre expressions of love.

**unITed:** Technology‚Äîboth as an industry and as a tool‚Äîhas, in many ways, introduced varying degrees of division and difficulty, particularly between generations, in my experience. ‚ÄúunITed‚Äù reflects my commitment to bridging that gap. It embodies the belief that the idea of ‚Äúpeople vs. technology‚Äù is a misnomer. Instead, we should focus on working with technology, not against it, to unlock our greatest potential‚Äîtogether.

**Solutions:** Lastly, the name Solutions comes from what I personally have loved so much about this career for the last 8+ years, providing solutions to not only right now problems, but also working together provide solutions for problems yet to arise!

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt just build solutions ‚Äî we build clarity, confidence, and a future you can scale into‚Äù
