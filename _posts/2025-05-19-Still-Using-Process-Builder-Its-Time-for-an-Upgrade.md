## Get Rid of Those Process Builders! A Smarter Path to Salesforce Automation

If you're still relying on Salesforce Process Builder to handle your automations, it's officially time for an upgrade. Salesforce announced that Process Builder and Workflow Rules are being phased out in favor of Flow — a more powerful, flexible, and future-proof automation tool. While the shift might feel daunting, it’s actually a golden opportunity to clean up and optimize your automations once and for all.

At **love unITed Solutions**, we’ve guided organizations of all sizes through this transition — helping them streamline operations, reduce technical debt, and harness the full potential of Flow. If you’re wondering where to begin, here’s a simple strategy to help you get started and make the most of the transition.

### Review All Existing Automations
Before you even open the migration tool, take stock of your current automation landscape. Many orgs have accumulated layers of Process Builders, Workflow Rules, and even Apex Triggers — often built by different admins over the years with minimal documentation. Now is the time to ask:
* Is this automation still necessary?
* Is it functioning as intended?
* Is it redundant with another process?
<br>
We recommend reviewing automations by object and business function. This ensures you're not just migrating clutter, but instead strategically updating your system to meet current business needs.

### Evaluate Areas for Consolidation
One of the key benefits of Salesforce Flow is the ability to consolidate fragmented automations into a single, streamlined process. In the old Process Builder days, you might have created multiple builders on the same object, each handling a different piece of logic. This led to performance issues, debugging headaches, and unclear execution order.

With Flow, you can combine multiple related automations into a single record-triggered flow. This offers better visibility, centralized logic, and easier maintenance — but it does require thoughtful planning. Look for:
* Similar criteria or trigger points across multiple automations
* Redundant logic being repeated across builders
* Opportunities to merge workflows into one optimized flow
* Consolidation not only improves system performance, but it makes your automation easier to scale.
<br>

### Map Out a Process Strategy
This is where many teams get stuck: how to go from chaotic builders to well-structured flows without breaking anything.

The key is process mapping. Outline each business process your automations support. Define what happens, when it happens, who’s involved, and what systems are touched. From there, you can determine:
* Which automations are high priority
* What the ideal Flow structure looks like
* Where manual processes can be automated for the first time
<br>
Don’t treat this as a one-to-one migration. Instead, think of it as a system upgrade. Clean up bad habits, build with best practices, and design flows with maintainability in mind.

### Use the Process Builder to Flow Conversion Tool
Thankfully, Salesforce provides a native Migrate to Flow tool that helps convert Process Builders into Flows with minimal effort. While the tool is a great starting point, it doesn’t eliminate the need for review and refinement.

Things to know:
* The tool handles simple builders well but can struggle with complex logic.
* It creates separate flows for each builder, so consolidation still needs to happen manually.
* Testing is critical. Even after migration, validate the new Flow against every use case the old builder handled.
