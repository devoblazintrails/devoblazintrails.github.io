# A little about me...
<br>
With over eight years of hands-on Salesforce experience, I’m a certified Salesforce Architect and seasoned professional with a comprehensive portfolio of certifications and a proven track record in architecting, configuring, and optimizing enterprise CRM solutions. Based in DeBary, Florida, I combine strong technical acumen with strategic project management skills to help organizations achieve digital transformation through scalable and sustainable Salesforce implementations.

### Technical Skills <br>
Technically, I’ve built and supported solutions across Sales, Service, and Marketing Clouds. I’m skilled with <strong>Flow Builder</strong> for declarative automation and have foundational <strong>Apex</strong> knowledge to customize complex business logic when needed. This gives me the flexibility to architect both low-code and code-enhanced solutions, depending on the challenge.

Beyond Salesforce, I’m proficient with <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>, <strong>Google Workspace</strong>, and a variety of data management tools—skills that contribute to user adoption, streamlined operations, and effective governance. I also have experience implementing the <strong>Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP)</strong>, which reflects my ability to tailor Salesforce solutions for mission-driven organizations and social impact initiatives.

### Certifications <br>
I hold multiple Salesforce certifications that reflect my breadth and depth across the platform. These include:
* Certified Administrator
* Sales Cloud Consultant
* Platform App Builder
* User Experience Designer
* Data Architect
* CRM Analytics and Einstein Discovery Consultant
* Marketing Cloud Account Engagement Specialist
* Agentforce Specialist
* Process Automation Accredited Professional <br>
These credentials underscore my expertise in Salesforce’s core capabilities and advanced skills in automation, data architecture, analytics, and user-centered design.

Today, my certifications align with key domains in the Salesforce Architect ecosystem, particularly Data Architecture & Management and Solution Architecture. These areas demand deep expertise in data governance, integration, and customer-centric design—all of which I’ve demonstrated through both practical experience and formal credentials.

Following the Salesforce Architect credential framework, I’ve developed both breadth and depth across the Customer 360 platform. My certification journey started with foundational knowledge and has grown into more specialized domains such as data architecture, solution design, analytics, and user experience. This structured growth positions me to lead comprehensive architecture initiatives and guide organizations through the complexities of multi-cloud environments.

### Soft Skills <br>
I bring strong communication and leadership skills to every engagement, backed by experience working in Agile environments, particularly using Scrum methodologies. I’m comfortable leading cross-functional teams, aligning stakeholders, and ensuring timely project delivery. My strengths in time management and public speaking complement my technical skills, helping to bridge the gap between business and technology.

Collaboration is a core part of how I work. I actively engage with developers, other architects, and business stakeholders to co-create solutions. My background in marketing and events, along with strong communication skills, supports my ability to connect with diverse teams—from executives to end users—and foster engagement across the organization.

I take a <strong>holistic approach to solution design</strong>—considering not just the technical architecture, but also the business value, user experience, and long-term sustainability. I apply systems thinking and hands-on configuration skills to ensure my solutions deliver impact and scale with the business.

In short, I’m a multifaceted Salesforce Architect who brings together <strong>technical excellence, strategic insight, and a collaborative mindset</strong>. I’m passionate about leveraging Salesforce to drive business outcomes, improve user experience, and build solutions that scale.
